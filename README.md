# jbeam-syntax
A little tool to help you not lose your mind entirely while working with jbeam files.
I hope it will prove useful to someone.

Best of luck in your jbeam work!

Some notes:
- This syntax highlighter is as bare-bone as they come.
- It won't do much to help you beyond the visual aid of the colors
- The main intent is to reduce eye strain
