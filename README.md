# jbeam-syntax
A little tool to help you not lose your mind entirely while working with jbeam files.
I hope it will prove useful to someone.

If you make something cool with our tools, we'd love to see it on [r/UsefulArtifacts](https://www.reddit.com/r/UsefulArtifacts)!

## Features
- Bare-bone lightweight syntax highlighter for jbeam files.
- Brace matching (keeps track of what belongs to what section)
- Folding (Will give your scroll wheel a chance to breathe)

## Contributors
- @Sondelll, Creator/Maintainer
- ..you? (Pull requests welcome!)

## Thanks to
- @tjx666, for the very convenient extension boilerplate [tjx666/vscode-extension-boilerplate](https://github.com/tjx666/vscode-extension-boilerplate)
- [Fillman86](https://www.youtube.com/@fillman86) on YouTube, if not for your diligent suffering through the BeamNG modding workflow this extension may never have been made.
